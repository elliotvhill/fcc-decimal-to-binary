# Decimal to Binary Converter
Following along with [freeCodeCamp's _Learn Recursion by Building a Decimal to Binary Converter_ lesson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#learn-recursion-by-building-a-decimal-to-binary-converter):

>_"Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve._
>
>_In this project, you’ll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. You’ll learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation."_
